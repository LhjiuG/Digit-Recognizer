# Digit-Recognizer
Hand written digits recognizer using a convolutional neural network.

This was made for the kaggle ["competition"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer). In the "competition", we had to create a network that could accurately label handwritten digits. There are multiple way to do this problem and I decided to go with a convolutional neural network. The architecture used is based on Lenet-5 with some ameliorations.
